# FileShare

## TODO:

[ ] Refactor AzureStorageHelper
[ ] Recreate homepage with upload functionality from /blobfiles (Similar look/feel to squoosh.app maybe?)
[ ] Determine how to set 24hr timer on assets uploaded to blob
[ ] Present share URL in nice format with ability to share on socials, potentially?
